<h1>🌍 BreatheSafeAI</h1>
<br>
AI-Powered Health & Environmental Risk Intelligence Platform

“Predict. Prevent. Protect.” — BreatheSafeAI integrates real-time environmental intelligence and personalized AI models to forecast health risks, detect environmental anomalies, and visualize future climate trends.

🧭 Vision

To build an AI-driven ecosystem that helps users make data-informed health and environmental decisions through predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and rich visual dashboards.

🧩 Core Features
🩺 1️⃣ Personalized Health & Eco Risk Assessment

🎯 Goal:
Predict how environmental factors (AQI, temperature, humidity, pollution) impact an individual’s health and eco-risk.

🧠 AI Model:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

📥 Inputs:

User profile: age, gender, health conditions (asthma, heart disease, allergies)

Predicted AQI / pollutant levels

Temperature, humidity, and weather forecast

Activity data: time outdoors, travel habits

📤 Outputs:

Health Risk: Low | Moderate | High | Severe

Eco-Risk: personalized carbon footprint or exposure risk

AI Advice: “⚠ High risk tomorrow — avoid outdoor exercise 3–6 PM”

📊 Visualization:

🧾 Dashboard card → “Your predicted health risk tomorrow: ⚠ High”

🗺️ Map overlay → Color-coded risk by location

📈 Line chart → Daily/weekly change in exposure

🧩 Comparison widget → “Your risk vs city average”

🌡️ 2️⃣ Trend & Anomaly Detection

🎯 Goal:
Identify long-term patterns and detect unusual events in climate data.

🔹 Trend Detection

AI Techniques:

Time-Series Models: LSTM, GRU

Seasonal Decomposition: STL, Prophet

Outputs:

Temperature, rainfall, AQI, and CO₂ trends

Predicted seasonal variations

“Next week’s pollution expected to rise by 15%”

🔹 Anomaly Detection

AI Techniques:

Autoencoders

Isolation Forest

Z-score / Moving Average Deviation

Outputs:

Abnormal spikes in AQI, rainfall, or temperature

Probability of extreme weather events

Regional anomaly distribution map

📊 Visualization:

📈 Line graphs → highlight anomalies with red markers

🌡️ Heatmaps → show spatial anomaly intensity

📅 Timelines → historical vs predicted anomalies

🧮 Summary → “3 anomalies detected this week”

🌐 3️⃣ Predictive Visualization Dashboard

🎯 Goal:
Show AI predictions intuitively with interactive visualizations.

🧠 AI Layer:

Sequence Models: LSTM, GRU, Ensemble Predictors

Real-time sync via REST or WebSocket

📥 Inputs:

Predicted: AQI, temperature, rainfall, pollutants

Risk scores (health + eco)

Detected trends and anomalies

📊 Visualization Types:

📅 Forecast Graphs → Hourly/daily predicted AQI & temperature

🗺️ Interactive Heatmaps → Regional pollution anomalies

🌐 3D Globe → Color-coded high-risk zones (Mapbox / Three.js)

⚖️ Scenario Comparison → “What if CO₂ rises 10%?”

🧾 Dashboard Cards → “Predicted high-risk days this week”

🧰 Visualization Libraries:

Plotly.js

D3.js

Leaflet.js

Three.js
 or Mapbox GL JS
